# Video Segmenter

This is a simple tool to segment videos into smaller clips. It was designed to
help with decomposing dances into individual moves, but it can be used for any
type of video.

## Approach

This is designed as a modern plain javascript web app, utilizing minimal dependencies,
and implementing using webcomponents.

## Installation

This is a web-based tool and is published using github pages. You can access it
at [https://jamesroutley.github.io/video-segmenter/](https://jamesroutley.github.io/video-segmenter/).

Running it locally is as simple as starting a development server in the root of
this repo. No build tasks are required.
